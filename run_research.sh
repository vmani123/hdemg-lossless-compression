# run_research.sh -- headless driver for the lossless-compression research loop.
#
# Runs the orchestrator agent non-interactively (`claude -p`) for a bounded number
# of cycles. Deterministic tools remain ground truth; the PostToolUse hook enforces
# bit-exactness on every codec edit. Human gates (after Stage 0 and Stage 2) are
# respected by the orchestrator's own stop conditions -- this script does not push
# past them.
#
# Usage:
#   ./run_research.sh                 # one orchestrator cycle, default turn budget
#   ./run_research.sh 8               # allow up to 8 tool turns this run
#   ./run_research.sh 8 "Test JPEG-LS 2D on real Hyser vs delta+Rice"
#                                     # seed the cycle with a specific hypothesis
#
# Requires the `claude` CLI on PATH and this repo's .venv + host_tools present.

PROMPT="You are the orchestrator. Run ONE research cycle of the lossless-compression \
loop by invoking the committed workflow: Workflow({ name: 'compression-cycle' }). That \
workflow encodes the canonical Survey -> Implement -> Measure -> Verify -> Analyze \
pipeline over 2-3 genuinely distinct candidates (per archive/COMPRESSION_RESEARCH_AGENT_PROMPT.md \
and the .claude/agents/*.md role defs), with an adversarial two-verifier gate per \
candidate. Do not hand-roll a one-candidate cycle. Read state first \
(research/LEADERBOARD.md, latest results/*.csv, recent experiments/*.md), then run the \
workflow, then commit the result. Respect every non-negotiable. STOP at the Stage 0 / \
Stage 2 human-review gates and stop if there is no ratio gain over the last N cycles with \
the Pareto front unchanged. Never invent a performance number; never promote a watch-list \
method."
