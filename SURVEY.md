# SURVEY — lossless multichannel biosignal compression candidates

Forward-looking, cost-filtered watch-list of **lossless** methods for the 128-ch
RHD2164 / HD-EMG node (STM32H745 Cortex-M7 + Spartan-7 XC7S25; integer/fixed only;
causal/streaming; must beat per-channel FLAC by exploiting cross-channel
correlation). **This file PROPOSES only** — no measured ratios, no codec edits.
Watch-list methods are never promoted without explicit human approval.

**What's already been tried lives elsewhere** — read those first so you don't
re-propose a spent lever:
- `research/INSIGHTS.md` — the durable principles (P1–P5), the current open
  frontier, and the dead-ends list.
- `research/CYCLE_LOG.md` — the append-only per-cycle ledger (one row per cycle).
- `research/LEADERBOARD.md` — the current best + Pareto front.

## Verdict key
- **embeddable** — integer, causal, bounded state/look-ahead, fits the sEMG budget
  (≤1831 cyc/sample-ch) and plausibly the 30 kHz neural budget (125 cyc).
- **borderline** — embeddable only after a specific simplification (noted).
- **watch-list** — expected to fail the cost gate today; track, never auto-promote.

## Live embeddable candidates (not yet spent)

These are the forward proposals still open. The full mechanism rationale is in
`INSIGHTS.md`'s "Open frontier"; this table is the survey-side pointer with the
literature grounding.

| # | method | why it may beat the current best | verdict | key caveat |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Scale-selected spatial front-end** — gate single selected best-partner (C≤64) vs jointly-solved best-pair (C≥128) on the decoder-observable channel count | The two per-scale winners are now measured (best-partner wins tight arrays, joint best-pair wins large); a zero-side-info channel-count gate (proven by `acar_sel`) is the first construction that could win the primary Hyser *and* hold the tight OTB corner | **embeddable** (both branches + gate already verified) | large-array win is only ~+1.1% at higher cost — measure the full 4-set profile vs the best |
| 2 | **Non-linear temporal predictor** (functional form, order ≤4) — a small sign-of-neighbour or gated-magnitude nonlinearity | A linear-LMS residual is white *to second order*; the only remaining temporal compressibility is higher-order. Multiplying linear coefficient sets is spent (`LMS4rs`, retired) — the form must genuinely change | **borderline → embeddable** | higher mechanism risk; pursue only if #1 doesn't clear the best. NOT the retired regime bank / entropy-context levers (P2/P5) |
| 3 | **FLAC fixed polynomial predictors (0–3), best-per-block + Rice** | cheapest upgrade over order-1 delta; near-LMS ratio at a fraction of the compute | **embeddable — shipped** (`fixed0-3+Rice`, on the Pareto front) | the value pick; already registered |
| 4 | **NLMS / leaky sign-LMS + Rice** (MPEG-4 ALS RLS-LMS direction) | normalised/leaky adaptation may track non-stationary EMG better, still one-pass | **embeddable** | our search shows order>4 *hurts* real HD-sEMG — keep order small (P2) |
| 5 | **JPEG-LS / LOCO-I(-ANS) 2D over the grid×time image** | MED/LOCO predictor + context + Golomb exploits 2D spatial structure; LOCO-ANS is a proven low-complexity FPGA encoder | **borderline** | context state per gradient bucket × channel; must beat #1 on a real 5×13/8×16 grid, not natural images. NB entropy-context on the Rice parameter is spent (P5) — the lever here is the 2D *predictor*, not the coder |

## Watch-list — DO NOT promote without human approval

Methods that fail the integer / causal / streaming gates today; tracked for
offline baselines and future reference only.

| method | note |
|---|---|
| Integer discrete flows (IDF), L3C, learned entropy models | learned lossless; float/GPU, no streaming budget — offline baselines only |
| Convolutional autoencoder + lossless residual | float core; disqualified on the FPGA target |
| VAE-DCT / neural context models | fail integer + latency gates today |
| TSCom-Bench / chained lightweight neural predictors (arXiv 2509.21002) | learned-lossless time-series; float/GPU, no streaming budget |
| GPU adaptive lossless FP framework (arXiv 2511.04140) | offline/GPU float pipeline; no integer streaming budget |
| Predictability-aware multichannel TS (arXiv 2506.00614) | lossy + neural + non-causal; disqualified, tracked for record |
| Compressive on-chip AP recording (IEEE TBME 11183845) | **LOSSY** (requantise + MI selective sampling); disqualified by lossless-only, listed for record |

**Reference-only (not a contender):** streaming floating-point time-series
compressors (Elf / Chimp / Gorilla, arXiv 2510.07015) are XOR-of-float oriented —
a poor fit for int16 biosignals where Rice/Golomb already dominates. A baseline
bar, not a candidate.

## The two settled spatial facts (from INSIGHTS, so the survey doesn't re-propose them)
- Cross-channel decorrelation is the dominant lever, but it's a **single rank-1
  adaptive subtract** — multi-tap transforms (fixed or adaptive) and summed
  multi-parent subtracts are dead ends (P3, P1b).
- The entropy back-end is at the floor — Rice is optimal for the near-geometric
  residual; neither an ANS swap nor any context-model of the Rice parameter helps (P5).
